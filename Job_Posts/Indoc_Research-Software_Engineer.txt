We are seeking a self-starter with good experience and great passion in data engineering, especially visualization and handling metadata.You, our ideal candidate, are looking for a small and dynamic multidisciplinary team of researchers and engineers who work together with minimal hierarchy and red-tape. You are prepared to bring your drive, your experience, and your passion to contribute at all levels to the entire team. We, Indoc Research, are that team. We build and manage complex medical research infrastructure for collaborators and clients. We bring together prominent research organizations across the country, including the Neuroimaging Group at the Rotman Research Institute, the Centre for Advanced Computing at Queen's University, and the Electronic Health Information Laboratory at Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. Together we have created large scale informatics platforms involving diverse and complex data modalities (e.g. imaging, proteomic, genomic, clinical assessments) across multiple disease areas (e.g. neurodegeneration, depression, cancer).In the FoRCE (Focus on Research and Clinical Evaluation) project, you will have the opportunity to stretch and develop your data engineering and visualization skills to a whole new level. FoRCE will require addressing complex data types in real-time, providing responsive and innovative visualization of high-dimensionality data, while maintaining security and privacy of data in a shared clinical and research setting. FoRCE will address critical gaps and fulfill currently unmet and urgent needs in both clinical and research communities, acquiring, federating and sharing data from distributed settings such as critical care units, clinical laboratories and hospital imaging facilities. FoRCE will enable real-time streaming of medical data, support novel cross-modality data fusion, while providing regulatory and ethics compliance as required in these clinical settings. As software engineer on this project, you will have a critical role at all levels of this project, in design and implementation, architecture and testing, deployment and support. And you will be building the future of medical science.Position Details: The Software Engineer will be responsible for the following development activities:Development of a metadata repository applicable to multiple data subsystemsImplementation of metadata management subsystemsDevelopment of data models representing multiple data modalities supported by the platformDevelopment and optimization of a data integration and federation subsystemDevelopment and implementation of data curation and data processing pipelinesQualifications and Desired Skills: Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering or equivalent3-5 years of applicable experienceData-Driven Web Development:Strong experience in front end design and implementation with CSS, HTML5, and responsive codeDemonstrated experience in D3.js or other JavaScript MVC frameworks such as ReactJS, Node.js, Ember.js, jQuery etc.Experience with data-driven product development, visualization, A/B testing, etcFamiliar with modern data management systems, including RDBMSs, NoSQL systems, and open source data warehousing systems.Experience in building Web Services (REST)One or two server side languages such as Python, Scala, PHP, Java.Experience with mobile-friendly web developmentFollowing general Scientific Programming skills would be advantageous but not required:Strong proficiency in one of the scientific programming languages, e.g. Python, R, ScalaExperience with XML, JSON, parquetGood understanding of data processing pipelines and data driven applicationsExperience with version control systems, Git, SVN. etc.Other Skills:Strong written and oral communication skillsTrack record of initiative and self-organizationWillingness and ability to work on multiple projects at the same timeSolid time management skillsDemonstrated ability to work within a collaborative team across multiple disciplinesWillingness to research and learn new approaches and technologiesHow to apply: Please submit your resume and cover letter by November 18, 2016 to info[at]indocresearch.org with the subject title "FoRCE Software Engineer Application".
